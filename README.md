## BANK MARKETING CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

### 1. General Information

You are a data analyst working in the Data Department at Bank X, headquartered in Spain. Recently, the bank has experienced a decline in revenue, and the director wants to know what measures to take.

After investigation, the Data Department head discovered that the core reason is that customers are not depositing as frequently as before. The fact is that term deposits allow banks to hold customer deposits for a specific period, enabling banks to use that money to invest in higher-yielding financial products to earn profits. Additionally, banks often persuade customers not only to make term deposits but also to purchase other products like funds or insurance to increase revenue.

Therefore, Bank X wants to identify existing customers who are more likely to sign up for term deposits and focus marketing efforts on those customers.

### 2. Data

Below is a dataset describing the results of Bank X's marketing campaigns in Portugal. The campaigns were mainly conducted through direct phone calls, inviting the bank's customers to place a term deposit. If, after all the efforts, the customer agreed to deposit, the “deposit” column would be marked as “Yes”, otherwise as “No”.
